###             Java8 & 9 Lambda Expression & Function Interfaces & Stream API & Flow API 学习导航

#### 1. Why Should I Learn The Core of Java8 & 9

* How to write simpler, cleaner, and easier-to-read code—especially around collections

* How to easily use parallelism to improve performance

* How to write less error-prone and simpler concurrent code

* Practice makes perfect and to Live to Learn


#### 2.Abstraction in OOP And FP

*   Abstraction is a concept that is familiar to us all from object-oriented programming.

*   The difference is that object-oriented programming is mostly about abstracting over data.

*   functional programming is mostly about abstracting over behavior.

*   The real world has both of these things, and so we can and should learn from both influences.
